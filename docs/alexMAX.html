					<h3>Max: How and Why</h3>
					<p>
						Over the summer I worked at an arts-technology day camp for high schoolers at <a href=”https://www.eyebeam.org/2019-digital-day-camp/”>Eyebeam</a>, helping facilitate daily workshops and taking plenty of notes. One of the great things about the job was that we actually had a partnership with Cycling ‘74, who taught 2 full-day workshops on audiovisual manipulation in Max/MSP/Jitter. Many of our students had never programmed before, yet in 4 hours were building sequencers and experimenting with motion tracking and sound. I’d never heard of Max, but by the end of the program I was impressed by its intuitive interface, powerful tools, and strong artistic community. We (the students and staff) were all gifted licenses for a year to use the program to our hearts’ content. However, I got the sense that once school started, I wouldn’t have the time or energy to devote to learning the program.
					</p>
					<p>
						I had come into PoE wanting a music project, and a music project I got thanks to my awesome team. But as we continued working with the Arduino, I started to feel more strongly about cracking open Max again and using it to make this project play the most sonorous of tones, as opposed to the grating limitations of Arduino square waves. It’s been interesting to work with something that pretty much nobody else on campus has experience with, but it gives me the opportunity to reach out to outside sources--something I’ll surely have to do in my own career--and to solve problems on my own. And by the end of this, I feel confident I’ll be able to teach my peers a thing or two about Max if they want to use it!
					</p>
					<p>
						I’ve never considered myself a strong programmer--I can get the job done but it’s more of a means to an end than anything else. I think the common visual structure and style of programming--words on a screen, encoded with an opaque sort of logic--dissuades the average person from thinking of it as accessible or creative. However, with the right tools, it is both. I really appreciate how user-friendly the Max interface is. You can access reference materials in the workspace, which also remains uncluttered by unnecessary toolbars. Keyboard shortcuts are simple and consistently make sense. The signal-flow structure shows direct logical connections between objects that work together. Who said programming has to be hard?
					</p>
					<p>
						I think a lot of classical programmers pride themselves on their ability to conquer the learning curve behind popular languages, and I would never discount the hard work they poured into their learning. However, I hope that the future of coding isn’t just about bringing people’s skill levels up to a challenging standard but accepting lowering the barrier to entry by improving interface design and experimenting with different means of representing information. For example, I have always thought of “block programming” as a learning tool--something for kids. But quite frankly, what about it isn’t “real” programming? Do you have to type, or (as most programmers do) copy someone else’s typed code to be entered into the elite pantheon of True Programmers?
					</p>
					<p>
						Contributing to the project using Max was, on the surface level, just a way of contributing with my own skillset. However, it’s led me to think more about what I want out of engineering resources and education, and reminded me that the paths I choose to take, even if unconventional or new, aren’t necessarily bad. I hope people will feel encouraged to experiment more and that my fellow team members also feel they had the opportunity to explore their interests and meet new challenges as I did.
					</p>

					<h3>Max: Trials and Tribulations</h3>
					<p>
						This project involved integrating Arduino with Max, and a quick web search led me to Maxuino, an interface to help facilitate connections between the two. I figured that, given the ubiquity of the system, it must’ve been pretty difficult to otherwise get the two to communicate, so I was happy to work with Maxuino.
					</p>
					<p>
						Essentially, you load your Arduino with standard Firmata protocol, which allows it to send and receive data out of its home workspace. Then you do all the programming in Max by designating the pin modes and reading them. A button press shows up on my computer. Pressure on the force sensor moves a slider. This was pretty easy and intuitive, and for the main few sensors, it worked just fine. However, I hit a snag when trying to work with the accelerometer--it uses the i2c protocol. While Maxuino swears by having i2c support, I couldn’t determine how to read any information from the accelerometer, in part because I didn’t fully understand what was going on under Maxuino’s hood and in part because there was very little information online about it. I’m still not sure I fully understand everything that was going on with Maxuino.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my efforts to figure out how to get i2c to work I figured out that, actually, it’s super easy to get your Arduino to talk to Max anyways without any extra tools. In the end, I had to simplify and do more code from scratch for a better result. As of writing this, we’re having trouble getting i2c to send information to Serial (another way of sending and receiving data on the computer) but at least once I get the data I have full control over it and know exactly what to do.
					</p>
					<p>
						I appreciate Maxuino as a tool and the help it provided to get me started, but sometimes you just need to have confidence in your own ability to get things done. More complicated interfaces with all the bits and baubles hidden away aren’t always better--sometimes they just confuse you! Taking a step back is a good idea in times of stress.
