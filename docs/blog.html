      After much ideation, we have decided on our idea. We wanted to do some project relating human motion to music, but now we have a more specific project. We are going to make a glove that uses force and motion sensors to play digital noises based on user input.

      After our first meeting of real work, we now have a “zeroth” prototype. It is a finger covering made of sticky notes and tape that has a button attached to it. When pressed, the Arduino displays that the button has been pressed. It is not much yet, but it is our first real physical prototype. Next we need to make it so a noise is played when the button is pressed. We have been looking at getting speakers to play around with that will suit our purposes. We have also been looking at getting some sensors that respond to fingertip pressure, not just on/off like this button. But overall this was a productive meeting and a good first step in our project.
