						<p>“0th Prototype”</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						After our first meeting of real work, we now have a “zeroth” prototype. It is a finger covering made of sticky notes and tape that has a button attached to it. When pressed, the Arduino displays that the button has been pressed. It is not much yet, but it is our first real physical prototype. Next we need to make it so a noise is played when the button is pressed. We have been looking at getting speakers to play around with that will suit our purposes. We have also been looking at getting some sensors that respond to fingertip pressure, not just on/off like this button. But overall this was a productive meeting and a good first step in our project.

						<p>“Shopping Adventure”</p>

						Now that we had a basic prototype, we determined it was time to start experimenting with the sensors we wanted to use in our final product. Unfortunately, the sensors we wanted weren’t available from the online ordering spreadsheet, and it would take too long to arrive. Thus, we turned our misfortune into an adventure and two team members - Katie and Shirin - decided to take a trip to a local electronics store followed by a bonding dinner at Panera. We were able to get 2 flex sensors, a force sensitive resistor, and 2 accelerometers. We then got distracted as any engineering student would and spent some time playing around with LEDs, followed up by a tasty dinner at Panera!
